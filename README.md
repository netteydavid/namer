Created by completing:
[Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)

The application generates cool-sounding names, such as "newstay", "lightstream", "mainbrake", or "graypine". The user can ask for the next name, favorite the current one, and review the list of favorited names on a separate page. The app is responsive to different screen sizes.
